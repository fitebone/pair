# Pair ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.7-blue)
**An Android app that sends data without an internet connection**

## Overview
This app, and the [API](https://github.com/fitebone/pair-api), was derived from my university capstone project for my BSCS. It sends data using WiFi LAN, BLE, and other mediums via the Google Nearby Connections platform. I have found this platform to be suitable only for Android development and aspire to develop my own alternative in the near future.

## Features
- Create a "card" that represents your identity
- Add profile picture and contact information to card
- Exchange cards with another user without any internet connection
- See data transfer progress real time
